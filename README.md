# AR Tag detection

This project will focus on detecting a custom AR Tag (a form of fiducial marker), that is used for obtaining apoint of reference in the real world, such as in augmented reality applications.There  are  two  aspects  to  using  an  AR  Tag,  namely  detection  and  tracking,  both  of  which  will  be  implemented in this project.  The detection stage will involve finding the AR Tag from a given image sequence while the tracking stage will involve keeping the tag in “view” throughout the sequence and performing image processing operations based on the tag’s orientation and position (a.k.a.the pose).
